# Weight-Based Authentication with Hexagonal Merkle Mountain Range (HMMR)

This repository contains the implementation of a novel blockchain-based authentication and verification mechanism for IoT healthcare systems. It introduces a **weight-based authentication model** for IoT devices and a custom data structure named **Hexagonal Merkle Mountain Range (HMMR)**, designed to improve verification speed, memory efficiency, and scalability.

## 🧠 Key Features

- **Weight-Based Authentication**  
  Devices are authenticated based on a composite weight derived from attributes such as:
  - Hardware trust
  - Security
  - Performance
  - Manufacturer certification
  - Network compatibility
  - Data integrity

- **Hexagonal Merkle Mountain Range (HMMR)**  
  A scalable, memory-efficient data structure used for:
  - Health data integrity validation  
  - Interaction validation  
  - Fast proof generation

- **Lightweight Design**  
  Tailored for constrained healthcare IoT environments (e.g., wearable medical devices, gateways).

- **Reproducible Results**  
  Code generates evaluation metrics (memory usage, depth, proof size) stored in `.csv` format used in published figures.
